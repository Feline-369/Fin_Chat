# Fin-Chat

A simple financial chatbot using Python, OOP, and a little bit of HTML/CSS. It is connected to a user-friendly web interface using Flask app. The chatbot employs cosine similarity to analyze a user's inquiry against a database of finance-related questions. If the best match surpasses a specified threshold, the chatbot provides the response associated with the most similar question. However, if the similarity falls below the threshold, the chatbot prompts the user to pose a different question.
